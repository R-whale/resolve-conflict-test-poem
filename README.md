# FoReveR And Always



* You aRe the sun that shines bRightly thRoughout my day.
* You aRe the gRavity that holds me down in eveRy way.
* You aRe the moon that shimmeRs thRoughout my night.
* You aRe staRs that glimmeR oh so bRight.

* You aRe the oxygen that keeps me alive.
* You aRe my heaRt that beats inside.
* You aRe the blood that flows thRough me.
* You aRe the only guy I can see.
* You have the voice of when a mockingbiRd sings.
* You aRe my eveRything.

* You aRe my one and only.
* You stop me fRom being so lonely.
* We plan ouR futuRe as if we have a clue.

* I neveR want to lose you.
* I want you to be my husband, and I want to be youR wife.
* I want to be with you foR the rest of my life.
